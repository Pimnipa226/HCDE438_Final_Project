For this assignment, I was working on converting my assignment 2 project into Vite React version. My project is a gallery
static web where users could find the art pictures by searching keywords in the search bar or click to choose the
categories of arts they want to see then the API will fetch the images from Unplash API. The result images will appear
by the 'Search Results' section. I was able to make the header part of the web app and the search bar
section. However, in the search results part, I was not able to organize the result images
I tried using grid, but it did not work properly. And another challenging I faced during this
project is to make accordion. Therefore, the 'Categoies'  part does not have the accordion working.

AI use: I used AI to help me with API in SearchBar.jsx and api.js file as it is different from the last assignment of
how we call API.
